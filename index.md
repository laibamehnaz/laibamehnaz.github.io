Hi! I am Laiba Mehnaz. I am currently working as a Research Assistant in MIDAS-IIITD under Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah. I have recently completed my B.Tech in Software Engineering from DTU in June 2020, and those four years will be the most cherished years of my life.ðŸ˜Š
<br>
<br>
I have had the privelege to be a part of MIDAS-IIITD family since my interniship with them in 2018. Throughout these years, I have worked on several Natural Language Processing related projects related to healthcare, offensive language on the internet, and now intensely on code-mixed Hindi English conversation systems. Apart from this, I am also interested in domain robustness and interpretability of pretrained language models. With how ubiquitous NLP is becoming, it is very exciting for me to see that I have the option of going deep in several other domains as well, where text can be leveraged for many potential applications pertaining to that field. 
<br>
<br>
One of my main focus right now is codemixed Hindi-English conversation summarization. We are working on releasing a dataset with Hindi-English codemixed conversations that can be used for several tasks such as summarization, translation, dialogue generation, etc. The dataset and code will be released as soon as the work gets published. :)

<br>
Beyond all this, I am also a compulsive reader. Most of my time outside of research goes into reading books. I like to keep my reading as varied as possible, and strictly not fiction. :P I love to discuss with people what they read, and if you think our interests overlap, you can drop me an email or message me on twitter. For seeeing my reading list, you can go to the ***Reading*** section.
