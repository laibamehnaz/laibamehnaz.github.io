Hi! I am Laiba Mehnaz. I am currently working as a Research Assistant in MIDAS-IIITD under Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah. I have recently completed my B.Tech in Software Engineering from DTU in June 2020. Those four years will be the most cherished years of my life.:relaxed:

I have had the privelege to be a part of MIDAS-IIITD family since my interniship with them in 2018. Throughout these years, I have worked on several Natural Language Processing related projects, mostly related to healthcare, offensive language on the internet, and now intensely on code-mixed Hindi English conversation systems. Apart from this, I am also interested in domain robustness and interpretability of pretrained language models. With how ubiquitous NLP is becoming, it is very exciting for me to see that I have the option of going deep in several other domains as well, where text can used for several potential applications.
