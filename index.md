Hi! I am Laiba Mehnaz. I am a second year master's student in computer science at NYU, Tandon School of Engineering. I am currently in my fourth semester. Since the last 2 semesters, I have also been working at [AI for Scientific Research](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/student-research/vertically-integrated-projects/vip-teams/ai-scientific-research) at NYU as the Research Lead. I overlook the growth and development of the researchers of the group, and specifically lead two teams working on benchmarking and protein function prediction. I also interned at Amazon during the summer as an Applied Scientist where I worked on multilingual domain adaptation. My main interest in the field of machine learning lies in natural language processing.

<br>
Before joining my master's, I was a Research Assistant in [MIDAS labs](https://midas.iiitd.edu.in/), IIIT-D, where I worked on several natural language processing projects under the mentorship of Debanjan Mahata and Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah. You can find my publications here: [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sjVEZ34AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&gmla=AJsN-F4ZCUbWdkmCAmN1f5XkR60PDKEfNoD4rsqcOAXgJtnjRK9NfduuLJA0-UjZpKvKJIXm4Gs3b_oME1DmLSgf0uCkyHWgzwRljUxERgSFdinLAKv7H1M)
<br>

Apart from all this, I am also a compulsive reader. Most of my time outside of research goes into reading books. I like to keep my reading as varied as possible, and strictly not fiction. :P I love to discuss with people what they read, and if you think our interests overlap, you can drop me an email or message me on twitter.
