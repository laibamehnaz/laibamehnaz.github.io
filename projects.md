## Unsupervised Domain Adaption for Sentiment Analysis using BERT
Collaborators | *Abdul Waheed, Bhavitvya Malik, Yifan Zhang* <br>
Using domain adversarial training we reduce the distance(MMD) between the source domain representations and the target domain representations for the task of sentiment analysis using the Amazon reviews dataset(Books being the source domain and DVDs being the target domain) leading to a clear increase in the accuracy on the target domain. This procedure is performed on all the layers of BERT and the perfomance is analysed. We also won the first place in the [17th SoC Term Project Showcase, NUS](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.smm4h-1.27/). <a href="laibamehnaz.github.io/Poster-2.png" target="_blank">[Poster]</a>
