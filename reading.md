<br> A book that I should have read a few hours back ðŸ˜…. But anyways, better late than never. Also, please don't confuse this with *made to stick*. This book is strictly about how we learn for better retention, and for using knowledge from different contexts to different conetxts. Still reading it, only 1/3rd is over till now.

<br> I loved the way the book was structured. Amongst the four superpowers(maker, hacker, teacher, and thief), *teaching* resonated with me the most. I realised how much I was underestimating the power of *making* while I was reading the book, and I have decided to work on this aspect. And most importantly, there are these exercises given in the end which are extremely useful. I honestly also love the tacky coverpage. :p

<br> This is one of the books that's closest to my heart. Started reading at a very low point in my life, and there couldn't have been a better solution to my problems than this book. My perpective of life changed quite a lot after reading this book. There are just so many gems in this book, and I would recommend everyone to read it. But if I had to point to one thing that stuck with me the most was that *you can win with the worst hand and you can lose with the best hand*.
