<br> I loved the way the book was structured. Amongst the four superpowers(maker, hacker, teacher, and thief), *teaching* resonated with me the most. I realised how much I was underestimating the power of *making* while I was reading the book, and I have decided to work on this aspect. And most importantly, there are these exercises given in the end which are extremely useful. I honestly also love the tacky coverpage. :p
