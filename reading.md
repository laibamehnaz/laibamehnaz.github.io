<br> I loved the way the book was structured. Amongst the four superpowers, *teaching* resonated with me the most. I realised the value of *making* and it's honeslty very empowering. And most importantly, there are these exercises given in the end which are extremely useful. I honestly also love the tacky coverpage. :)
