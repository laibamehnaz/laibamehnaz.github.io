<br> A book that I should have read a few hours back 😅. But anyways, better late than never. Also, please don't confuse this with *made to stick*. This book is strictly about how we learn for better retention, and for using knowledge from different contexts to different conetxts. Still reading it, only 1/3rd is over till now.

<br> This book is just so powerful. Because of this book I have started reading several reports predicting the future trends in anything whatsoever. It's just a wonderful state to be in when you are in the process of decision making. Just strated, will update when I finish the book. 😅

### Past reads

<br> I loved the way the book was structured. Amongst the four superpowers(maker, hacker, teacher, and thief), *teaching* resonated with me the most. I realised how much I was underestimating the power of *making* while I was reading the book, and I have decided to work on this aspect. And most importantly, there are these exercises given in the end which are extremely useful. I honestly also love the tacky coverpage. :p

<br> This is one of the books that's closest to my heart. Started reading at a very low point in my life, and there couldn't have been a better solution to my problems than this book. My perpective of life changed quite a lot after reading this book. There are just so many gems in this book, and I would recommend everyone to read it. But if I had to point to one thing that stuck with me the most was that *you can win with the worst hand and you can lose with the best hand*.

<br>Chose this book from the list of must reads for becoming a data scientist 😂, well, when I was in that phase. This book should be a must for *anybody*, I could buils a strong intuition behind the concepts of statistics only because of this book. Love the conceptof the series, adding *naked money* and *naked economics* to the list. 😍
